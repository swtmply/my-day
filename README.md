# My Day

This is a digital event logger that I use to track my daily events. I log the following information:

* **Day:** The date and day of the week.
* **Health:** My overall health, including my energy level, sleep quality, and pain level.
* **Spending:** My daily spending, broken down by category.
* **Weather:** The weather conditions for the day.
* **Dream:** My dreams, if I remember them.

Rate each event on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. 
This helps the user to track their day over time and to identify areas that makes their whole day and year.
